# Soda Machine

Whenever I go to a fast-food restaurant, I prefer having a cold soda drink that has a few cubes of ice. Thus, recently, I decided to go to the Subway and have some soda and fill the cup with cubes of ice.

Holding an empty cup to fill in the soda, I got closer to the soda machine. I had already noticed the drink I wanted to have and the ice option in the middle of the machine. I poured a little of the soda into the cup and decided to add some ice. The icing options, however, didn't have the lever as all the soda machines do. **My mental model** (personal simplified understandhing of how the machine physically works) was that it had some optical or motion detection camera installed. I put my cup under the ice output. But nothing happened. Then I decided to put it closer, assuming the leverage for the output of the ice was like a button you have to put your cup close to the icing machine and it would pour, but nothing happened again. Nevertheless, I recieved a **feedback** from the machine. I noticed the output of the icing machine was moving as it touched the cup during my previous attempt. I pushed the output towards the machine, and the ice finally poured. Then I decided to finish filling it in with the soda. As it was fully filled, I moved to add the covering to the top of the cup and the straws, both of which are right next to the machine. The straw had a protecting covering. Conveniently, there was a trash can for the straw coverings near the straws themselves. Now I can enjoy my cooled soda.

(P.S: turn on the sound to hear when the ice poors in)
